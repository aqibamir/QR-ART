# QR-ART

You have to tweak around with the parameters to get the optimal results 

Best results are achieved when you provide a reference image that resembles the prompt. 

If you want minimal art , change the init_image to source_image in the pipeline. 

If the generated image closely resembles the original QR code, we suggest gradually increasing the strength value while reducing the conditioning scale.
